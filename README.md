# Project

> This is a project for learning how to create and publish NPM packages also learning on how to implement telemetry in a package and
> other concepts like wrapping a library, abstracting a common library to reduce boilerplate code, cross platform and framework agnostic package, etc.
>
> If you have found intrusive code in this package, it's probably because of how we want to implement and explore gathering telemetry data. A way to disable it be provided in future, the goal was implement and explore the telemetry gathering process, we can't develop a telemetry gathering process without actually gathering telemetry data right. I also run and manually test this on my machine.
